# Railway Configuration for Supermemory Web
# This file tells Railway how to build and deploy the Next.js web service
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a shared monorepo - builds must install from root
# to ensure @repo/* dependencies are available

[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
# Install all dependencies from monorepo root, then build the web app
buildCommand = "cd /app && bun install && bun run --cwd apps/web build"

[deploy]
# Start Next.js from monorepo root to access @repo/* packages
startCommand = "cd /app && bun run --cwd apps/web start"

# Next.js will automatically use PORT environment variable provided by Railway
