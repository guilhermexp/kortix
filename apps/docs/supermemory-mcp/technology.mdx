description: 'Technical implementation details of supermemory MCP'
---

The technical architecture prioritizes **simplicity and user experience** while maintaining robust functionality. Built as what the creators describe as "the simplest thing you'll see" - essentially a React Router application making fetch calls to the supermemory API - the entire system was developed and shipped in approximately 5 hours of actual work time.

### Architecture components

- **Backend API**: Built on top of the supermemory API (http://localhost:4000/v3)
- **Transport Layer**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication
- **Dynamic Server Generation**: Creates unique MCP server instances for each user via URL path parameters
- **Session Management**: Maintains complete user isolation through unique URLs
- **Infrastructure**: Fornecida pelo backend Bun em `${SUPERMEMORY_API_URL}/mcp`, com SSE persistente gerenciado pelo próprio servidor

O sistema aproveita o backend self-hosted, mantendo conexões SSE leves: a maior parte do tempo as sessões ficam ociosas aguardando comandos, então o consumo de CPU é baixo mesmo com conexões prolongadas.

## The two main components explained

### addToSupermemory action

This component **stores user information, preferences, and behavioral patterns** with sophisticated triggering mechanisms:

**Trigger methods:**
- **Explicit commands**: Direct user instructions like "remember this"
- **Implicit detection**: Automatic identification of significant user traits, preferences, or patterns during conversations

**Data types captured:**
- Technical preferences and details (e.g., "My primary programming language is Python")
- Project information and context (e.g., "I'm currently working on a project named 'Apollo'")
- User behaviors and emotional responses
- Personal facts, preferences, and decision-making patterns
- Rich context including technical details and examples

### searchSupermemory action

This component **retrieves relevant information** from stored memories using advanced search capabilities:

**Activation triggers:**
- Explicit user requests for historical information
- Contextual situations where past user choices would be helpful for current decisions
- Automatic context enhancement based on conversation flow

**Search capabilities:**
- **Semantic matching**: Finds relevant details across related experiences using vector search
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifies behavioral patterns and preferences
- **Cross-session retrieval**: Accesses memories from previous conversations and platforms
- **Intelligent filtering**: Returns most relevant context based on current conversation needs
