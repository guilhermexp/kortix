# Railway Configuration for Supermemory API
# This file tells Railway how to build and deploy the API service
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a shared monorepo - builds must install from root
# to ensure @repo/* dependencies are available

[build]

# Install all dependencies from monorepo root, then run postinstall for markitdown
buildCommand = "cd /app && bun install && cd apps/api && bash install-markitdown.sh"

[deploy]
# Start the API from monorepo root to access @repo/* packages
startCommand = "cd /app && bun run --cwd apps/api start"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"

# Railway will automatically set PORT environment variable
# The API will listen on the port provided by Railway
