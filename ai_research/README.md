# AI Research & Experimentation Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains research notes, experiments, proof of concepts, technology evaluations, and findings from exploration and investigation. It serves as a repository for learnings, performance benchmarks, and experimental features.

## Document Categories

### Performance Research
- Benchmarks and performance analysis
- Optimization experiments
- Load testing results
- Scalability studies

### Technology Evaluation
- Library/framework assessments
- Tool comparisons
- Integration feasibility studies
- Architecture experiments

### Proof of Concepts
- Experimental features
- Novel approaches
- Integration prototypes
- Feature exploration

### Investigation Notes
- Problem-solving research
- Root cause analysis
- Performance profiling
- Debugging investigations

## Research Status Indicators

- 🟢 **Complete** - Research finished, conclusions drawn
- 🟡 **In Progress** - Actively researching
- 🔵 **Planned** - Research scheduled
- ⚪ **On Hold** - Temporarily paused
- ⚫ **Archived** - Historical reference only

## Adding Research

When documenting new research:

1. Create descriptive directory or file
2. Use consistent naming convention
3. Include methodology and approach
4. Document findings clearly
5. Draw conclusions with supporting evidence
6. Include recommendations
7. Reference related issues/documents
8. Add to this README's directory listing

## Key Research Areas

### Performance Optimization
- Vector search optimization
- API response time improvements
- Frontend rendering optimization

## Cross-References

- **Documentation**: See `ai_docs/` for implementation results
- **Specifications**: See `ai_specs/` for formal requirements
- **Issues**: See `ai_issues/` for discovered problems
- **Changelog**: See `ai_changelog/` for integration results

## Using Research Findings

When research is complete:

1. Update documentation (`ai_docs/`) with conclusions
2. Create specification (`ai_specs/`) if feature implementation is planned
3. File issues (`ai_issues/`) for any discovered problems
4. Reference research in implementation documents
5. Archive research to historical section

## Last Updated

October 30, 2025 - Research directory structured and documented

## Guidelines

- Document methodology, not just conclusions
- Include data and evidence
- Be specific about test conditions
- Note limitations and caveats
- Include dates and version information
- Reference code commits and branches
- Link related research and documents
- Archive complete research appropriately
- Share findings with team promptly
- Update status indicators regularly
