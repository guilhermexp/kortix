# AI Changelog Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains the historical record and change log of all Supermemory project updates. It tracks all modifications, features added, bugs fixed, and improvements made across all versions.

## Contents

- **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Main changelog file documenting all changes from v1.x to v2.0+
  - Organized by semantic versioning
  - Includes feature additions, bug fixes, breaking changes
  - References to related commits and issues

## Organization

Changelog entries follow semantic versioning format:
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major feature releases
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features, non-breaking additions
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, improvements

Each entry includes:
- Date of change
- Version number
- Category (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.)
- Description of changes
- References to related code/commits
- Breaking changes (if any)

## Guidelines for Adding Entries

1. Update the CHANGELOG.md file when significant changes are merged
2. Use the Keep a Changelog format
3. Add entries under appropriate version section
4. Include links to related commits/issues
